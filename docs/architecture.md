```

## Dependency rule

Dependencies only point downwards:

```
presentation  →  core  →  api / db
```

- **Presentation never bypasses the gateway.** `SessionCli` (or the future GUI
  controller) orchestrates a session by calling only `Gateway` methods, and
  delegates every prompt/preview to its interaction implementation
  (`CliInteraction`).
- **The core never talks to the user.** It has no `input()`, no previews, no
  knowledge of the CLI: every choice is a parameter, every output is a value.
- **The api layer never imports the core.** Adapters receive plain values
  (names, paths, options, booleans) from `main.py`; the only shared modules are
  `consts.py` and the persistence interfaces they are handed (for example the
  WiFi camera receives the `StateStore` instance to persist `last_read_wifi_id`).
- **db is infrastructure.** `StateStore` is the single persistence point of
  `temp_data.yaml`; services receive it, they never open state files directly.

## Session flow (CLI)

```
main.py (wiring)
  └── SessionCli.run()
        gateway.prepare()
        loop:
          SessionCli.main_execution()
            ├─ Gateway.pending_photos() / discard_pending_session()   # disaster recovery
            ├─ CliInteraction.ask_resume_session() / choose_pending_photo()
            ├─ Gateway.capture_hint()  →  CliInteraction hint
            ├─ Gateway.capture_photo()
            ├─ CliInteraction.confirm_shot()  →  Gateway.accept_capture() / reject_capture()
            │     (on reject: CliInteraction.notify_photo_rejected())
            ├─ Gateway.frame_strategy() / next_frame() / preview()
            ├─ CliInteraction.show_preview_image()  →  Gateway.abort_session()
            ├─ Gateway.send_to_backend()  (non blocking)
            ├─ CliInteraction.choose_times_to_print()
            ├─ Gateway.enqueue()
            └─ while Gateway.prints_pending(): Gateway.print_next()
```

## Configuration and paths

- `PHOTOBOOTH_HOME` (environment variable, default: current working directory)
  is resolved by `main.py` and points at the folder containing `settings.yaml`,
  `Assets/`, `temp_data.yaml` and the log file.
- Every component receives its paths from the composition root: `Settings(path)`,
  `StateStore(path)`, `AssetManager(assets_path)`,
  `setup_logging(log_file)`. Tests inject a temporary home and clean it up.
- Launch from the project root (as before): `uv run photobooth` or
  `uv run python -m photobooth.main`.

## Documented exceptions

- `presentation/cli/interaction_cli.py` imports `detect_os` from
  `photobooth.api.platform_api`: this is the **only** allowed exception to the
  `presentation → core` rule. Launching the OS image viewer is a presentation
  concern and it reuses the platform adapter already available in `api/`;
  injecting it through `main.py` was considered but discarded as overkill for a
  small, read-only helper.

## Utilities kept for future use

These are intentionally unused for now and are kept (not dead code to delete):

- `core/disaster_recovery.py::has_pending_session()` — not called yet; it is
  the boolean counterpart of `pending_photos()`.
- `Gateway.next_frame(photo_path)` — the `photo_path` parameter is currently
  ignored; it exists for symmetry with the other gateway calls and for future
  frame-per-photo logic.
- `FrameChooserService.DEFAULT_STRATEGY = 'random'` — historical behaviour: the
  `'manual'` strategy is reachable by passing `fallback_strategy='manual'` to
  the constructor (configuration of the strategy from settings is a possible
  future improvement).

## Known technical debt

- `api/backend/backend_api.py` duplicates the same upload/login flow for the
  async and sync variants (`upload_pil` / `upload_pil_sync`). This pre-dates
  the layered refactoring; a future cleanup could keep a single implementation
  with a thin async wrapper.
- `api/local_storage_api.py::AssetManager` assumes that the `Assets/` folder
  exists and contains at least one PNG. A missing folder raises
  `FileNotFoundError` (from `os.listdir`); a folder without PNG files makes
  `is_frame_single()` return `False` and `get_corners_names()` return an empty
  list, so the `'random'` strategy reaches
  `FrameChooserService.next_frame_name` and raises `IndexError`.
- `api/printer_api.py::Printer.get_printer_options` only catches
  `subprocess.CalledProcessError`: if the `lpoptions` binary is missing,
  `FileNotFoundError` is raised unhandled from `Printer.prepare()`.
- `api/camera/gphoto2_camera.py` `capture_via_camera`/`capture_via_pc` call
  themselves again on `GPhoto2Error` with no limit nor backoff: a persistent
  error can lead to unbounded recursion.
- `core/editor_service.py::EditorService._build_output_path` strips a fixed
  four-character extension (`[:-4]`): it assumes `.jpg`, so `.jpeg`/`.png`
  names would be truncated incorrectly.

## Conventions

- `*_api.py` — adapters to external systems (in `api/`).
- `*_service.py` — application services (in `core/`, or `api/backend/` for the
  backend service which is only an orchestrator of the HTTP client).
- `interaction_cli.py` — prompt/render implementations;
  `session_cli.py` — the CLI session script.
- `Gateway` has no suffix: it is the core facade.

## Possible future improvements

- A `PHOTOBOOTH_HOME`-aware asset/settings migration to move configuration out
  of CWD entirely (the injection points already support it).
- An extra `api/` driver for a different camera library (only `camera_api.py`
  and `camera_service.py` would change).
